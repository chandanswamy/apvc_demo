            A. Suryanarayana, E.E.(Retd.)on the irregularities&nbsp; in&nbsp; execution of 
            works of CPWS schemes in Vontimitta and Pondaluru in Kadapa Dist.&nbsp; 
            The charges are that&nbsp; that he failed to discharge his duties&nbsp; in 
            conducting&nbsp; prescribed hydraulic test&nbsp; resulting&nbsp; in leakages of 
            pipes and water not flowing through pipes thus the water was never 
            delivered to the habitations / hamlets and also that lead to an 
            additional expenditure of&nbsp; Rs.60 lakhs&nbsp; to Government&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            Inquiry Authority held that the&nbsp; charges against&nbsp; Sri A. 
            Suryanarayana, EE&nbsp; proved.&nbsp;&nbsp; On examination of the Inquiry&nbsp; 
            Authority’s report,&nbsp; Commission advised the department in letter 
            dated: 27-9-2006 to&nbsp; recover an amount of Rs.1,65,239/-&nbsp; from him

            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 150%">During a Surprise 
            Check conducted by the Officials of the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Sri 
            K. Subrahmanyam, former Municipal Commissioner, Kakinada was found 
            in possesion&nbsp; of a huge amount of Rs. 1,28,400/-&nbsp; while on travel 
            from Kakinada to Hyderabad for which he could not give any valid and 
            satisfactory explanation.&nbsp; The investigations conducted by the ACB 
            confirmed that the said amount was nothing but illegal gratifacation 
            secured by the A.O. from the contractors.&nbsp; Considering the 
            overwhelming evidence revealed by the Bureau`s investigations, 
            Commission concurred with the Bureau`s recommendations and advised 
            the department for according prosecution on 17.4.2006 .&nbsp; But , in 
            its initial response, the department , instead of prosecution, took 
            a decision to initiate departmental action against the accused.&nbsp; 
            Subsequently, the Minister proposed&nbsp; on 21.5.2006 for even dropping 
            the proposed departmental action on the ground that the accused was 
            not given reasonable opportunity to explain on the points raised by 
            the Bureau and that he is retiring within a year`s time.&nbsp; Though on 
            this proposal, both the CS and the CM seconded the VC`s opinion only 
            i.e., for the prosecution of the accused, the issue was re-examined 
            with reference to a representation forwarded by the Minister of 
            Major Irrigation.&nbsp; Then, it was opined by the Minister for M.A. 
            again that the accused was neither trapped nor found in possession 
            of disproportionate assets and that there are no strong grounds 
            warranting his prosecution. On this,&nbsp; Chief Minister agreed with the 
            views of the Chief Secretary that it may not be possible to sustain 
            a prosecution in this case and passed orders for the initiation of 
            departmental action only against the accused which is in deviation 
            of VC`s&nbsp; advice.&nbsp; </span></p>
