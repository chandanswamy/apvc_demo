&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disciplinary 
action was initiated against Smt.K.Leelavathi, Deputy Director of Adult 
Education (</span><font face="Garamond">Retired</font><span style="font-family: Garamond"> on 29-02-2000) based on the financial irregularities noticed 
by the then Director of Adult Education, Hyderabad, while conducting arrear and 
current inspection of O/o. the Deputy Director of Adult Education, Khammam and 
test check on the expenditure items of Zilla Saksharatha Samithi, Khammam and 
general review of T.L.C./ P.L.C./ C.E. from 10-02-2000 to 12-02-2000.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-indent: 33.15pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Garamond">&nbsp;Commission in its advice dated 
04-11-2006 has observed that the crux of the charges is irregularities in 
implementation of total literacy campaign during 1991-2000 and non settlement of 
accounts and the Charged Officer made no efforts to settle the accounts during 
her tenure.&nbsp; Permanent assets like Mahindra Zeep, Generator should have not 
been purchased under total literacy programme.&nbsp; Irregular acquisition of 
capital assets to the tune of Rs.5,58,345-00 should have been avoided. Open 
Tender System in procurement of materials like paper for printing T.L.C. primers 
at cost of Rs.56,24,696/- was not followed. The department was advised to impose 
the penalty of 15% cut in pension permanently and stoppage of gratuity on Smt.K. 
Leelavathi, Dy.Director, Adult Education (Retired), duly following the procedure 
under Rule 9 of A.P.R.P.R., 1980.&nbsp; But, the Department has issued orders in 
G.O.Rt.No.289, dt.20-4-2007 dropping further action against her, which is a 
deviation against the advice of the V.C. (Department is being requested to refer 
the connected file).</span><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case 
against Sri B.Anjaiah, CI of Police, Narasingi Circle of Cyberabad City was 
registered for being in possession of assets disproportionate to the known 
sources of income on 29-5-2003 and enquired by the Anti Corruption Bureau. As 
per preliminary report dt.27-8-03 there is substantial evidence to show that the 
A.O. is in possession of disproportionate assets worth Rs.65,59,434/-.&nbsp; The 
A.O. was placed under suspension by the DG &amp; IG. </font> </p>

On the advice of the Commission, Government in G.O.Ms.No.221, Home Dept. 
dt.6-10-2004 accorded sanction to the I.O. of the Bureau for filing an 
application before the competent court for attachment of properties of the A.O. 
and his family members worth Rs.52,02,447/-.&nbsp; The Bureau filed an 
application before the competent court on 28-10-04 and the court issued

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 
examination of final report of the D.G., A.C.B. dt.15-2-06, Commission in letter 
dt.22-12-2006 advised the department&nbsp; to prosecute the A.O. in a court of 
law duly revising the list of disproportionate assets and also to initiate 
departmental action as recommended by the Bureau.&nbsp; Govt. in G.O.Rt.No.650, 
Home Dept. dt.11-5-2007 instead of prosecuting him in a Court of Law on the 
disproportionate assets cases decided to take departmental action for not filing 
Annual Property Returns all through from the year 1976 till date and also for 
not taking proper permission to acquire immovable and movable properties.</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri Vangala 
Nageswara Babu, Assistant Executive Engineer, Panchayat Raj, Amrutalur mandal, 
Guntur district was caught red-handed on 23-8-2006, when he demanded and 
accepted a bribe amount of Rs.10,000/- from the complainant, Sri Chadalavada 
Ramesh Babu for processing bills for works.&nbsp; He himself came to complainant 
after a phone call and accepted the tainted amount.&nbsp; At the time of post 
trap proceedings, the accused officer himself admitted having received the 
amount and took out a wad of currency notes from his upper left side shirt 
pocket and produced before the Mediators.&nbsp; In view of the clinching and 
irrefutable evidences, such as, positive chemical test, recovery of tainted 
amount from the shirt pocket of the A.O., corroborating 161 &amp; 164 Cr.P.C. 
statements of the complainant, immediate reply of the A.O., Commission on 
11-1-2007 advised the Panchayat Raj &amp; Rural Development Department to prosecute 
the A.O. in a court of law for the offences punishable under the Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1988.&nbsp; Further, the A.O. in his explanation in reply to the 
statutory notice averred that he would disclose his defence only in the 
Honourable Court at appropriate time.&nbsp; But, the department on 28-5-2007 
issued orders entrusting the case to the Tribunal for Disciplinary Proceedings 
for inquiry into the allegations.&nbsp; Thus the department deviated from the 
advice of the Commission. </font> </p>
