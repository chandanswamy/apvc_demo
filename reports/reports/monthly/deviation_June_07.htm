            Sri 
            E.Raghuramaiah, Labour Officer, O/o the Asst.Commissioner of Labour, 
            Nellore was trapped on 15.9.2003 when he demanded and accepted 
            illegal gratification of Rs.1000/- from the complainant for doing 
            official favour.&nbsp; </font></span>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the final 
            report submitted by the DG, ACB the Department was advised to&nbsp; place 
            the Labour Officer on his defence before TDP. The Government 
            entrusted the case to TDP. The TDP in its report stated that charge 
            of demand and acceptance against the Labour Officer, is not 
            established by the prosecution. Therefore, the AO is found not 
            guilty of misconduct within the meaning of Rule 2 (b) of The AP 
            Civil Services (DPT) Rules, 1989 and he is entitled for exoneration 
            fully. </font>

            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commission observed from the TDP 
            report that the fact of pendency of petition filed by PW-1 is 
            established.&nbsp; The CO has not given satisfactory explanation for 
            keeping silence on the petition for a very long time, though he gave 
            two adjournments,&nbsp; after that he kept silent.&nbsp; The trap money was 
            found in the table drawer of CO.&nbsp; Neither the mediator report nor 
            the mediator mentioned the presence of DW-1.&nbsp; The presence of DW-1, 
            Advocate, at the time of trap has to be doubted and that no prudent 
            person will keep the tainted money in CO’s table drawer especially 
            when a third party that too before an Advocate being physically 
            present in the room.&nbsp; The evidence of the clerk bringing the file 
            after approach by PW-1 and C.O. giving adjournment date on it lends 
            support of prosecution allegation of C.O. doing favour only after 
            receipt of illegal gratification.&nbsp; In view of the above, Commission 
            advised the department to disagree with the findings of TDP and to 
            communicate the disagreement factors to the Charged Officer for 
            submission of his written statement and to examine the same and 
            arrive at the punishment to be imposed</font></P>

            deviated from the advice of this Commission by obtaining orders in 
            circulation on the ground that the matter was elaborately dealt by TDP and finally held that the Charged Officer not guilty on any 
            count and recommended for his exoneration and passed orders to drop 
            further action against Sri E.Raghuramaiah, Labour Officer, vide 
            G.O.Ms.No.47, LET &amp; F Dept., dt. 26.5.2007, instead of communicating 
            disagreement factors to the Charged Officer for submission of his
